## Quarantine

A key part of containing infectious diseases is putting people who may be sick into quarantine. You are tasked with building an application to keep track of people who have been exposed to the disease. This should support an operation adding a person based on their unique identifying number. It should also support querying the number of people who should be quarantined. Since people will be added whenever it is discovered they came into contact with an infected person, it is possible that multiple attempts will be made to add a person. Even in this case, the person should only be counted once.
